# 6-Week DSP & Physics R&D Software Engineer Crash Plan

This plan is designed to help you become a hire-ready candidate for back-end software engineering roles in DSP and physics-focused R&D environments, especially those requiring C++ and applied signal processing.

## Week 1 — Modern C++ Foundations & Build Systems

**Goal:** Learn idiomatic modern C++ and master build tools like CMake.

**Tasks:**
- Read and practice key features from *A Tour of C++* (Stroustrup), focusing on:
  - Smart pointers (`unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`)
  - `auto`, `range-for`, lambdas
  - Move semantics and RAII
- Write simple resource-managing C++ classes
- Set up a basic `CMakeLists.txt` to compile your code
- Compile and run a simple CLI using CMake

**Resources:**
- [A Tour of C++](https://www.stroustrup.com/Tour.html)
- [CMake Tutorial](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/tutorial/index.html)

**Deliverable:**
- Modern C++ project with classes, smart pointers, and a clean CMake build.

## Week 2 — Core DSP Implementation in Modern C++

**Goal:** Build and test a core DSP algorithm in C++.

**Tasks:**
- Implement a basic FIR filter or FFT pipeline in C++ (using STL and/or libraries)
- Apply error handling and modular structure (split into headers, sources)
- Add unit tests using GoogleTest or Catch2
- Create a CLI that accepts input/output filenames and parameters

**Resources:**
- [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest)
- [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2)
- [The Scientist and Engineer’s Guide to DSP](http://www.dspguide.com/)

**Deliverable:**
- A tested, modular DSP algorithm CLI tool.

## Week 3 — CS Fundamentals for DSP & Real-Time

**Goal:** Build key data structures and strengthen algorithmic thinking.

**Tasks:**
- Implement a circular buffer (ring buffer) class in C++ with push/pop methods
- Practice ~15 LeetCode problems (C++) covering:
  - Arrays, strings, hash maps, sliding window
- Study trees, recursion, and graphs for systems design understanding

**Resources:**
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com)
- [Ring Buffer in C++](https://embeddedartistry.com/blog/2017/4/6/circular-buffers-in-cc)

**Deliverable:**
- Ring buffer C++ class + LeetCode progress documented in a GitHub repo.

---

## Week 4 — Multithreading & Performance Optimization

**Goal:** Learn concurrency and optimize real-time DSP processing.

**Tasks:**
- Refactor your DSP algorithm to use `std::thread` or OpenMP
- Benchmark single-thread vs. multithreaded version
- Learn basic performance profiling with tools like:
  - `perf` (Linux), `valgrind`, or Visual Studio Profiler
- Explore cache behavior, SIMD (e.g., using Eigen or manual unrolling)

**Resources:**
- [C++ Concurrency in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/c-plus-plus-concurrency-in-action)
- [OpenMP Tutorial](https://bisqwit.iki.fi/story/howto/openmp/)
- [Linux perf Tutorial](https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Tutorial)

**Deliverable:**
- Multithreaded, profiled DSP code with performance report.

---

## Week 5 — Software Engineering Best Practices & Documentation

**Goal:** Write professional-grade, collaborative code.

**Tasks:**
- Add `README.md` with clear usage instructions and build steps
- Add Doxygen-style documentation in your header files
- Create a GitHub Actions workflow for CI:
  - Build + run tests automatically on commit
- Use Git branches, pull requests, and squash merges

**Resources:**
- [Doxygen Guide](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html)
- [GitHub Actions for C++](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-c)

**Deliverable:**
- Fully documented, CI-integrated GitHub repo with working C++ project.

---

## Week 6 — Domain Expertise & Communication

**Goal:** Demonstrate your expertise and prepare for technical communication and interviews.

**Tasks:**
- Write a 1–2 page technical blog post or GitHub wiki explaining a DSP technique (e.g., FFT, filtering)
- Solve 10 more LeetCode problems, focus on medium difficulty
- Prepare answers for DSP & C++ interview questions
- Practice explaining your project to both engineers and domain scientists

**Resources:**
- [DSP Interview Questions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/digital-signal-processing-interview-questions/)
- [Medium.com](https://medium.com) or [Dev.to](https://dev.to) for example blogs

**Deliverable:**
- Blog post or technical summary + interview prep notes + updated GitHub portfolio.

## Final Tips

- Keep code quality high: no warnings, use `.clang-format`, comment non-obvious logic
- Reach out to R&D teams with your GitHub and blog as proof of work
- Get peer review or feedback from mentors on one project
- Revisit and improve past projects using what you learn each week
